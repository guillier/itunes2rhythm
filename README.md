Transfer of music library from iTunes to RhythmBox

Needed a solution to play the music managed by iTunes on a Linux box.
Found a script, initially witten by Jacques Fortier in 2004, then modified by Yan Zhang in 2009.

It which was working OK-ish but not all songs were imported (specially the one with names relying a lot on Unicode) and first start of RhythmBox was very slow and usually finishing by a core dump.

I then decided to improve the script until it was transfering 100% of my songs:

* Upgraded code to Python 3
* Code clean-up
* Added correct UTF-8 (NFD -> NFC form) support for metadata and directories
* Better configuration file support
* Upgraded RhythmBox 's xml schema to version 1.8
* Upgraded iTunes xml (file generated by version 11)

To use it, EDIT FIRST the itunes2rhythm.conf file, to fix the mapping and the directories which are system dependant.

Then it can be launch simply by ./itunes2rhythm.py

Hope this can also be useful to someone else. Enjoy!
